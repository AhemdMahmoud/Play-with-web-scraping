# Play-with-Web-Scraping
### This project scrapes a web page for football match details on a specific date entered by the user and saves the data to a CSV file, including the teams' names, the match time, and the result.
## Quick Start
### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AhmedMahmoud1D/Play-with-Web-Scraping/blob/main/WebScrap.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> (recommended)
  
âš  _Colab provides a temporary environment: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._

### Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code?

* [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/AhemdMahmoud/Play-with-web-scraping/blob/main/WebScrap.ipynb) also works but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.
